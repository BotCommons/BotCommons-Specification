## Exposure

The specifications do not assume a specific way to expose the botcommons metadata.
Several media have been identified:
- a public HTTP endpoint,
- a bot command exposed on the messaging platform
- a database that would store multiple bot specifications

The specification documents how the public HTTP endoint and the bot command should be exposed in order to facilitate the emergence of a common and shared industry practices.


### HTTP endpoint

### Native Bot Command

We would like to have the bot give us some meta info about himself.

For that to happen, the bot will expose a `.commons` command.

The command will return a subset of the botcommons metadata, as well as a link to the full set of metadata.

This subset of metadata, can be returned in 
Bot command subset of metadata

### Database
